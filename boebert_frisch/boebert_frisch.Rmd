# A problem with the Frisch dataset is that many of the donations were routed to his campaign from ActBlue, and all of the ActBlue receipts are earmarked as coming from Massachucetts, even if they were made by someone in Colorado. This will mess with my analysis here, so I am going to filter out the ActBlue contributions. This waters down Frisch's dataset quite a bit, but it is the only way to ensure an accurate count.
